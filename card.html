            <p>Regardless, always begin with level one headings to level two, etc. Special headings called section labels are used for certain sections of a paper which always start on a new page. These labels should be positioned on their own line at the top of the page where the section starts, in bold and centered.

            <p>A heading is similar to a caption, a line below a photograph that briefly explains it. Headings show up at the top of paragraphs, chapters, or pages, and they give you an idea of what the subject is.
